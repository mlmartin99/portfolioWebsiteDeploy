      <h2 class="bio-title">About Me</h2>
        <p class="bio-text">
            I recently graduated Computer Engineering at the University of Manitoba in May 2023. I have
            over 2 years of engineering experience in the hydro electric industry. I have worked in 
            hydroelectric consulting, distribution engineering, and generation modelling, applying my
            computer engineering skills to configure RTUs, aggregate power quality data, perform power system studies,
            maintain and improve linear optimization modelling processes, and more. My strengths are parallel
            and distributed processing and embedded systems in C or Python.
            </p>
            <p>
            I have focused my extracurricular projects towards embedded systems design, including holding a software 
            position on the UMSAE Polar Bear Racing Electric team throughout university and completing small personal projects utilizing STM32 and 
            Arduino development boards. I have also increased my web development skills through creating this 
            website and programming JavaScript web games. 
          </p>
          <p>        
            In my spare time I volunteer at the Winnipeg Humane 
            Society as a dog walker. I like to get active and get outside daily. On the weekends you can find 
            hiking, biking, strolling with my dog, reading, or working on a programming
            project, and spending as much time as possible
            with loved ones and friends. I love trying new things and pick up new skills quickly!
            </p>
            <p>
            This website showcases some of my programming skills and projects. You can find my resume and a contact form
            near the bottom of the page. Check out my Linked and GitHub, too, by clicking the

          <h4 class="project-title">Design and Implementation of an Autonomous Tennis Ball Collecting Robot</h4>
          <p class="project-details">
            This was my undergraduate Capstone project, completed in a team with 6 other individuals. We successfully created a robot
            that could collect and detect tennis balls in a 10x10 meter area (about half of a tennis court) when commanded.
            It stored the tennis balls onboard the robot and return to a home base position once all tennis balls were collected.
            The robot used an OpenCV camera and neural network for tennis ball detection, and a greedy path planning
            algorithm. The camera feed along with detection boxes were streamed over WiFi to a user interface.
             It successfully collected 5 tennis balls in the designated area in under 5 minutes.
          </p>
          <p class="project-details">
            My responsibility for the project was the robot drivetrain. I sourced parts, constructed the chassis,
            configured the onboard electronics, and programmed the drivetrain. The programming included interfacing
            with the motor control to drive and steer the robot and reading from the motor encoders using an STM32. I also
            implemented the motor control interface to the path planning module with a ROS UART Bridge and Docker. I aided
            in the integration of the entire ROS project. The link below is to a public repository on my GitHub. The folders 
            in the repository are extracted from a private GitHub organization page, and I have only included portions that
            I was a main contributor on.

          <h4 class="project-title">Hard of Hearing Curling Communication Device</h4>
          <p class="project-details">
            This embedded systems group project was completed for a Digital Design Systems course and aimed to aid hard of hearing
            curlers with communication between the skip and the sweepers. The project involved the 
            completion of a a functional prototype, using ESP32s, and a physical prototype through 3D
            printed TinkerCAD files. Our design solution used one-way WiFi communication (ESP-NOW) to 
            send instructions from the skip to the sweepers. The skip issued commands by providing pushbutton input 
            on a remote control device. The sweepers received the instructions via LEDs on a device fastened 
            to their broom. Our design solution also featured sleep/wake cycles for power saving. My portion
            of the project was the receiving (sweeper) device functional prototype and sending (skip) device
            physical prototype. All code for the project was written in C using the Arduino IDE.

          <h4 class="project-title">Useless Box</h4>
          <p class="project-details">
            My boyfriend and I created this fun, multi-disciplinary, 3D printing and embedded systems project over winter
            break in 2021/22. I completed the majority of the code and circuitry, while he completed much of
            the box design and 3D printing. We did, however, take the opportunity to complete the project as team, and 
            I learned a little about Mechanical design and 3D printing, while he practiced some basic coding.
            The basic function of the useless box is to turn the switch into the OFF position using an Arduino and Servo
            motor when the user moves the switch into the ON position. I implemented this functionality using interrupt-driven
            C-style Arduino programming, and additionally added an 8x8 LED matrix to display a happy or sad face when the
            switch is in the OFF and ON state, respectively. Take a look at the program on my GitHub by clicking the link below!
